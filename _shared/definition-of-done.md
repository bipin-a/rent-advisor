# Factory definition of done

This workspace serves one human maintainer working with AI agents. The human owns product intent, material technical choices, acceptance, readiness, and production authorization. Agent work supplies drafts, implementation, and evidence; it does not replace those decisions.

## Finished workflow run

A Project workflow run is done when:

- the released change matches the human-approved Product and Technical Specifications;
- validation identifies the exact candidate, environments, data sources, results, failures, and skipped proof;
- the readiness decision disposes of every material finding and approves the exact release candidate;
- the human explicitly authorizes production release after reviewing the known risks and rollback and monitoring obligations;
- the production result is verified; and
- the Project's build, validation, readiness, and release records link to the evidence, with any earned lesson applied to its canonical source.

A merged pull request or successful non-production deployment is not, by itself, a finished workflow run.
